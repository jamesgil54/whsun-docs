> Computational materials science and engineering uses modeling, simulation, theory, and informatics to understand materials. The main goals include discovering new materials, determining material behavior and mechanisms, explaining experiments, and exploring materials theories. - Wikipedia

To be a successful computational materials scientist, not only must we be proficient in the science and mathemetics behind materials, but also in computation.

This section aims to provide brief tutorials introudcing a variety of programming paradigms and resources group members have found useful in their own research. Most of these topics will be **Python** orientated.
